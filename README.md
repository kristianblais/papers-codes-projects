# papers-codes-projects
A repository containing a collection of completed papers, code files, and other personal projects such as graphs and maps.

This repository is intended to show a sample of my coding knowledge and the projects that resulted from said code. There are academic papers, non-paper related coding projects, as well as miscellaneous maps and figures that I have also authored. This is not an exhaustive list of all my work, it is only intended as a sample for potential employers.
